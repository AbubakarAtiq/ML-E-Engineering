in this class we are going to discuss

about flag resistor we already take an

introduction about flag register in the

architecture of 8:08 for a

microprocessor this is basically 8-bit

register so you can see all eight bits

here so as Jed ACP and CY our user bits

in this flag register that means in that

eight bits of flag resistor we will use

only four five bits that means es means

sign flag when s is equal to one means

if MSB of ALU result is equal to one

then only your sign flag is equivalent

to one and coming to zero flag when Judd

is equal to one means if n your result e

will shows you 0 0 H then only you are

zero flag will be activated that means

your ALU result will shows 0 0 H then

you your zero flag will be activated

then coming to parity flag whenever your

result is in given parity than your

parity bit is activated or is equal into

one coming to carry flag

so whenever carry occurred if carry or

borrow occurred in addition or

subtraction then your carry flag will be

activated and gives one and coming to

auxilary carry so carry when this

auxilary carry is equal to one means if

carries from lower to upper nibble is

carried or borrow from upper to lower

nibble is carried then you will get

auxilary carry is equal into 1 but this

auxilary carries cannot be accessed by

the programmer so this can be this only

used by the computer this only accessed

by the computer and it's used for BCD

addition purpose now I will show you an

example which will shows this sign flag

and auxilary carry and carry and

everything so now I am going to take an

example I want to add BC D so I want to

add BCD

so BCD means you know that these two are

hexadecimal numbers two-bit hexadecimal

numbers I want to add this external

numbers you know that the value of B is

silver and C is 12 and D is 13 is 14 so

now I am taking that binary values bees

of lemon means so here 1 0 1 1 and C's

of 12 12 means 1 1 0 0 and here D is of

13 13 means 1 1 0 1 so this is 13 and E

of 14 means so here you can take 1 1 1 0

so now we need to add these two so now I

am adding these 2 0 0 will result you 0

0 plus 0 0 0 plus 1 1 1 plus 1 0 with

carry 1 1 plus 1 plus 1 then they one

weight carry 1 now here 1 plus 1 plus 1

again 1 weight carry 1 1 plus 1 0 with

carry 1 again 1 plus 1 0 with carry 1

here again you got three ones for

addition then you are going to get one

with carry 1 this carry is taken in

carry flag now if you compare this

result with your flag register then

finally you can see the result a plus C

is nothing but 14 and C is nothing but

12 14 plus 12 so here 14 plus 2 all

means 26 26 we cannot represent in

hexadecimal then how will do so 26 minus

16 will take then the result is 10 here

so tell me here you are having a width

of hexadecimal carry one we will take

all you know about hexadecimal Eddie

in the starting unit we take in this

hexadecimal addition in digital

electronics so now here B means he at 11

and D means you're 30

11 plus 13 is equivalent to 24 24 plus

125 so 25 also we cannot represent in

hexadecimal then we'll take 25 minus 16

is equal into 9 then what we'll do so

here 9 with hexadecimal carry 1 we will

take so here you can observe this is 9 a

1 0 1 0 means she a and this is 998 the

result with hexadecimal carry 1 here how

we will place once in this flag resistor

means coming to s this is a sign from

when it will be 1 means if MSB of L your

result is 1 that means most significant

bit of Lu Lu you know that Lu is a bit

so in this 8 bits the MSB is 1 here if

MSB of Lu result is 1 then sign flop is

1 for this result for this operation if

you saw your flight register then this

will be is equivalent to 1 coming to

zero flag when zero flag is equal to 1

means if he Lu result is 0 0 H then only

that is equal to 1 but here your a new

result is not is equal into 0 0 H this

having some value like 9 e so you a 0

flop won't be activated here and will be

put as 0 so now coming to palette is

love so parity flag will be activated or

gives 1 whenever a Leo result is an even

parity

now you can observe

ILU result this is if even parity or not

you need to check so here you can

observe for once for once in digital

data means that is in even parity

definitely you can put your party flag

as equivalent to 1 in this particular

operation so now coming to carry flag

whenever carry or borrow occurred during

addition or subtraction then your carry

flag will be activated so we are getting

final enter on the carry

so that's why so your carry flag is

equal into 1 yes we got carry that's one

you takin this carry as equalling to 1

coming to auxilary carry carry from

lower to upper nibble or borrow from

upper to lower nimble in case of

subtraction is occurred then you can put

your auxilary carry is equivalent to 1

now you can see here so this is one

nipple and this is one nipple so here

one from these people to this symbol you

got carry so in this addition of three

words you got one with carry 1 so that

means this carry so this particular

carry carry from this lower able to

upper neighbor so that's why your

auxilary carry value is also equal into

1 but this auxilary car a carry we can't

access so that means programmer is not

having access to curb salary carry that

will be internally used by the computer

like in BCD Edition like that type of

operations it will be internally used by

the computer so like this flag resistor

is going to set it value according to

the operations
