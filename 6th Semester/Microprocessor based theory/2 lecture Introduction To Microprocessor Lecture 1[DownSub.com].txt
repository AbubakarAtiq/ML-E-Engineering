 microprocessor is a cpu in a micro

computer so here in this microprocessor

this is nothing but a single integrated

circuits which combines ALU and control

unit and memory so here you can see the

definition of your microprocessor

microprocessor is a central processing

unit on a single integrated circuit

containing millions of very small

devices includes transistors resistors

and diodes so here you can see so many

examples for microprocessor so four zero

zero four is one of starting

microprocessor with 4-bit world length

and 640 bytes of the addressing capacity

and 16 pins so it's having 16 pins that

means that I see 4 0 0 4 microprocessor

IC is having 16 pins so similarly we are

having 8 0 0 8 microprocessor that's of

8-bit you can see the mole length is

keep on increasing from one micro

processor to another micro processor so

this is of 16 KP addressing capacity

this having 16 KB addressing capacity

and the number of pins are 18 so like

that we are having next micro processor

at 0 at 0 so here also the wall length

is 8 bit but addressing capacity is

increasing from 16 KB to 64 KB now the

number of pins also increased in this

micro processor the number of pins are

40 here and coming to 8 0 8 5 this is

very important micro process that we

need to discuss because in in any

technical exams they will ask 8 0 8 4 &

8 0 8 6 only so here for 8 0 8 5 micro

processor this is also 8-bit word length

that means 8-bit microprocessor and here

it's having 64 KB addressing capacity

and coming to the number of pins from

here onwards you are having 40 penises

that means 4 8 0 8 5 IC we are having 40

pins so here we have

8:08 microprocessor in which the woldn't

is increased from 8-bits to 16-bits from

this onwards our volunteers increased to

8-bits to 16-bits so for this the

addressing capacity is 1 MB and here the

pins are same with same 40 pins here

while length is increased and addressing

capacity is increased so 8 0 8 5 & 8 0 8

6 are very important for any technical

point of view technical exam point of

view here not only these microprocessor

we are having so many micro process like

Pentium and Pentium Pro Pentium 2 all

these we are having as our micro process

which we are using widely in today's so

here simply micro processor is nothing

but a IC so integrated so many

transistors it's a integration structure

of so many transistors diodes and

resistors so here coming to by send-up

kb so here you can see KB KB is nothing

but so kilobytes so here what is meant

by a byte generally you can absorb bit

signal digital data so Big D is nothing

but single digit in a binary data it's

called as bit so nibble is nothing but 4

bits combined that is called as nibble

coming to bite bite is nothing but 8

bits that means how you are having 1 0 1

0 1 0 1 1 1 1 like this so if you group

or 4 bits then that is called as a

nipple if you group with 8 bits then

that is called as a byte so group of 8

bits is called as a byte so now so this

is about small introduction of micro

processor from next day onwards we are

going to discuss name from next class

onwards we are going to discuss the

architecture of 8 0 8 5 processor and

addressing modes and everything

are going to discuss from next class
