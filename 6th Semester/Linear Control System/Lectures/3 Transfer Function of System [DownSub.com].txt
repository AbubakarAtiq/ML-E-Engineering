in this video we are going to discuss

the transfer function of a control

system now tell me for control system

for any system the transfer function is

the ratio of Laplace transform or

transform of output to transform of

input that is the ratio of transform of

output to transform of input

similarly for control system also the

transfer function of a control system is

the ratio of Laplace transform of output

to Laplace transform of input so

generally in Laplace transform stopping

we are going to prefer Laplace

transforms so the equation of transfer

function is equivalent to Laplace

transform of output to Laplace transform

of input with zero initial conditions so

here for example I am having a closer

look at the whole system like this so

I'm having our fer FES as my input

transform and I'm having a somewhere

here so I'm having a negative feedback

system like this and here this is my

open-loop gain G and this is my output

transform and this about my feedback my

feedback gain is hich feedback element

gain eh so this is my closed loop

control system here where input is R of

T where the input transform is our

office and output is C of T and the

Laplace transform of that output C of T

is C of s so everything I consider in

terms of frequency domain and gains so

here in case of this system this is a

negative feedback system in case of this

system so if you want transfer function

so you need to get by using C obvious by

RF es you need to get C obvious pair of

his so how we can get C of s by our

office before getting C obvious by our

office or transfer function I want to

get the value here so here you can see

this is our Fe s minus C a fearsome 2

so this is the point of C obvious so see

our fear seemed to hinge so I am

considering like CH or C of s into H so

this is the point so here this signal

and the feedback signal feedback signal

is nothing but a to see office so

H in to see off is so obvious

- itching to see of years so hey chin to

see office will be the value or at this

point output at this point output so are

obvious - hit chin to see office the

gain where H is the feedback loop gain

and C obvious we are taking as feedback

with gain hitch so here the value at

here is equaling to our affairs - hitch

into C office now if you want to write

the equation for the output at present

point so the C office is equal into our

of his our FES - hitching to see of

years H in to see of his into G so here

I can write this as our epheus into G

our epheus into G minus gh into cos gh

into C office I am just multiplying two

inside the G are multiplying two inside

here I am having C obvious and then C

obvious I am having here so now I can

take that CFS to left side so I will get

I can take common of C obvious 1 plus gh

is equal to RF yes into G but to get

depends a function the equation is

Laplace transform of output by Laplace

transform of input the Laplace transform

of output is C office Laplace transform

of input is our affairs to get transfer

function T

you need to get crcs by orifice form so

if you say me saref yes to this side you

are going to get the transfer function

of the system like this way you need to

calculate for positive feedback system

also so maximum we are going to prefer

negative feedback systems so G by 1 plus

gh will be the transfer function of

negative feedback system so like this if

you calculated the same for positive

feedback system you are going to get G

by 1 minus gh so this is about transfer

function of the system in the next class

we will see how many types of feedbacks

are there so this is negative feedback

system we are having positive feedback

also in the next class we will see how

many types of feedbacks are there how

will write the transfer function of that

positive and negative feedback control

systems

so you'll see clearly there so this 4

negative feedback system the same we are

going to derive in the next class also

along with positive feedback system so

here the transfer function is nothing

but the ratio of output transform by

input transform in case of control

systems we are going to prefer our

output transformer C office and input

transform as our office this is closed

loop control system output this is a

reference input so that's why I am

representing with R so here control

system output I am representing with C

so the transform Laplace transform of

this output is equal into C of s and the

Laplace transform of input our reference

signal is equal into our office when you

want C office by our office form then

that is nothing but the transfer

function of that particular control

system

Transfer Functionof a control system is the ratio of laplace transform of output to laplace transform of input.
 
C(S)=[R(S)-H(C(S))]G
Take common on both sides.
