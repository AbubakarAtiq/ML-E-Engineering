A system which consist of number of components connected together to perform a specific function
in which the output is controlled by input
Open loop system:
Advantages:
1.Simple and economical
2.easier to construct
3.Stable
Disadvantages:
1.In accurate
2. Changes in the output are not
 corrected automatically.
Closed loop system:
Advantages:
1.Accurate
2.less effected by noise.
Disadvantages:
1. Complex and costly
2. Feedback reduces the overall gain of the system.
3. Stability is a major problem.
